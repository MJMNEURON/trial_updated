The Retina command with relatives paths (to be launched from root folder of your archive) is :
Retina -ret /fkb/serverDirectory/retina/demo/retina_config/EXAMPLE_cat_X_cell.xml -outD retina_0/output -nodisp -i sequences/fullcontrast_0.seq -r 1
the command launched is this one : 
/home/awohrer/Ogygie/Softwares/VirtualRetina/local/bin/Retina -ret /fkb/serverDirectory/retina/demo/retina_config/EXAMPLE_cat_X_cell.xml -outD retina_0/output -nodisp -i /fkb/serverDirectory/retina/session/CB60E3F73B8D7BAE67C0F5223CA88A8F.tomcat1/sequences/fullcontrast_0.seq -r 1
Hello! This is the retina simulation program!
Input is the list of 2-dimensional images, starting at sequences/fullcontrast_0-000000.png and finishing at sequences/fullcontrast_0-000099.png.
Given your chosen eye movements and/or imposed center of fixation,this program will feed the retina with cropped images of dimension (158,155).

The retina is currently allocating all its elements!
Size of its maps was fixed at: (52,52).
Initialization of the retina (OPL only) by a uniform screen of luminance 127.5.

(1) OUTER PLEXIFORM LAYER:
Allocating values for the linear version UndershootOPL.
Low-pass filter for each layer of cells is a non-separable leaky heat equation.
Allocating values for the LINEAR version LinearOPL.
Low-pass filter for each layer of cells is a non-separable leaky heat equation.

(2) CONTRAST GAIN CONTROL MECHANISM:
Allocating values for a conductance-based contrast-gain-control.

(3) SPIKING LAYERS OF GANGLION CELLS:
1 layers of ganglion cells were defined, amongst which 1 are spiking channels, for a total of 1 spiking ganglion cells.
Retina data, including position of units, has been saved as : retina_0/output/retina.xml

Retina will now be tested on 100 frames of the input sequence, each frame lasting 0.00500000 theoretical seconds.
